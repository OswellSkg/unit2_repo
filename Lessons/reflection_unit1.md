# UNIT 1 REFLECTION


## What worked well during unit 1?
### I think what worked well in Unit 1 is solidifying my basic skills for programming and computational skills. 
### Furthermore, I've established a basic understanding and a sense of how Dr. Ruben teaches computer science, 
### as well as how IB Computer Science operates in ISAK.

## What did not work well?
### In Unit 1, I highly struggled with time-management. Due to having insufficient knowledge and below-average programming skill, 
### I struggled to keep up with class as well as to keep track of my work. 

## What did you enjoyed the most during project unit 1?
### Although it was the hardest and toughest, the most enjoyable part of unit 1 for me was creating the digital ledger. 
### Through creating the digital ledger, I had the opportunity to truly solidify the skills and knowledges that I've learnt
### in class by applying it flexibly. 

## What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
### There is not a specific talent of mine that I've successfully discovered, but I am looking forward to figuring it out
### in Unit 2. 

## What is working well in Computer Science for you?
### I think self-study is working well for me as I also work on the Computer Science subject. 

## What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
### When someone schedules a mentoring session, maybe Dr. Ruben can create a document to put the date and time of it so other students who needs it can join as well.
